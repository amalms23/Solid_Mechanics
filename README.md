### Strain Tensor Rotation and Transformation

This script performs the transformation of a strain tensor due to a rotation about the x-axis. It takes an initial strain matrix defined in the original coordinate system and applies a rotation matrix to compute the transformed strain matrix in the new coordinate system.

#### Author:
- **Name**: Amal M S
- **Affiliation**: PhD Student, Aerospace Engineering, IIT Kanpur

#### Description:
This MATLAB code calculates the transformed strain tensor after a rotation about the x-axis by an angle \( t \). The rotation matrix used corresponds to a basic 3D rotation about the x-axis, and the transformation rule applied is:

\[
\epsilon'_{kl} = A_{ki} A_{lj} \epsilon_{ij}
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the rotation matrix,
- \( \epsilon \) is the original strain tensor.

#### Usage:
To run the script:
1. Define the symbolic strain components and the angle of rotation.
2. Execute the script to obtain the transformed strain matrix in the new coordinate system.

#### Features:
- Symbolic computation of the strain tensor transformation.
- Flexible enough to adapt for different rotation angles or axes.

### Plotting P vs. Theta for a One Degree-of-Freedom Structural Model

This repository contains MATLAB code to plot the relationship between the applied load (P) and the deflection angle (theta) for a simple one degree-of-freedom structural model, as described by the equation:
where:

*   `P` is the applied load.
*   `K` is the rotational stiffness of the spring.
*   `L` is the length of the rigid bar.
*   `theta` is the deflection angle in radians.

This equation represents the critical loads for which the system can have non-trivial equilibrium configurations (i.e., deflected states).


### Usage

1.  **Open MATLAB.**

3.  **Copy the code** or **Open the file** in MATLAB.

4.  **Run the script:**

    ```matlab
    Model_A_stable_symmetric_bifurcation_buckling.m
    ```

5.  The script will generate a plot of P vs. theta.


## Key Features and Improvements

*   **Small Deflection Analysis:** The code specifically analyzes the system's behavior for small deflections around θ = 0 (vertical position). The theta range is limited to `[-0.025*pi, 0.025*pi]` (approximately ±4.5 degrees).
*   **Near-Singularity Handling:** The function `P = (K/L) * (θ / sin(θ))` has a singularity at θ = 0. The code avoids division by zero by using small non-zero values (±0.001) near zero, providing a more accurate representation of the rapid change in P in this region.
*   **Zoomed-in Plot:** The y-axis limits are adjusted to focus on the region around P ≈ K/L, allowing detailed observation of the load-deflection relationship for small deflections.
*   **Two Versions (Improved Accuracy):** The script contains two versions of the plotting logic:
    *   A basic version using `linspace` directly, which is simpler but less accurate very close to zero.
    *   An improved version that splits the theta range, excluding a tiny region around zero, for enhanced accuracy and stability near the singularity.
*   **Clear Plotting and Labeling:** The plot includes clear axis labels (Theta (radians), P), a title displaying the K and L values, and a grid for readability.
*   **Parameter Customization:** The constants `K` and `L` are defined at the beginning of the script and can be easily modified.

## Interpretation of Results

The plot generated by the script shows the relationship between the applied load `P` and the deflection angle `θ` for small deflections. The behavior near θ = 0 is particularly important:

*   As θ approaches 0, `P` approaches `K/L`. This value represents the critical load for the perfect vertical configuration.
*   The slope of the P vs. θ curve near θ = 0 is related to the initial stiffness of the system.

## Further Enhancements that can be done

*   **Interactive Plotting:** Implement interactive features (e.g., data cursors) for detailed examination of plot points.
*   **Parameter Input:** Allow users to input K and L values via command-line arguments or a GUI.
*   **Stability Analysis:** Extend the code to perform a more rigorous stability analysis (e.g., by examining the second derivative of the potential energy).
